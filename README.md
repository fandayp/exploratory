# Welcome to my exploratory projects!

This repository is intended as a compilation of various exploratory machine learning and data science projects I've completed to apply new techniques and technologies to real-world problems.

## [Customer Review Topic Clustering](https://github.com/fandayp/exploratory_projects/blob/main/customer-review-topic-clustering.ipynb)

---

As a business owner, customer reviews can be a valuable source of insight. This project aims to segment user reviews into several topics for easier analysis.

The key components of our project include:
- **Review clustering**: to segment customer reviews into distinct clusters by representing the reviews as word vectors (combination of pre-trained [Transformer model](https://github.com/UKPLab/sentence-transformers) and self-train [Word2Vec model](https://radimrehurek.com/gensim/models/word2vec.html)),
- **Topic labeling**: to label review topics within each cluster using a large language model (LLM).

**Keywords**: review clustering, nlp, word vector, embedding, llm, word2vec, pca, autoencoder.
